This guide will walk you through a basic example using Roboflow Inference to run inference on fine-tuned and foundation models. We will run inference and save predictions using an object detection model and CLIP.

For this tutorial, we have prepared two notebooks:

1. Save computer vision model predictions in Supabase
2. Calculate and save CLIP embeddings in Supabase

## Save Computer Vision Predictions

Once you have a trained vision model, you need to create business logic for your application. In many cases, you may want to save inference results to a file. 

Let's talk through how to run a visino model locally and save predictions to Supabase.

### Step #1: Install and Start Roboflow Inference

### Step #2: Run Inference on an Image

### Step #3: Save Results in Supabase

## Calculate and Save CLIP Embeddings

### Step #1: Install and Start Roboflow Inference

### Step #2: Run CLIP on an Image

### Step #3: Save Embeddings in Supabase
