## Logs & Debugging

Logs are provided for each function invocation, locally and in production.

### How to access logs in production

You can access logs in two ways:

- **Invocations**: shows the Request and Response for each execution. You can see the headers, body, status code, and duration of each invocation. You can also filter the invocations by date, time, or status code.
- **Logs**: shows any platform events, uncaught exceptions, and custom log events. You can see the timestamp, level, and message of each log event. You can also filter the log events by date, time, or level.

You can access both tools from the [Functions section](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/functions) of the Dashboard. Select your function from the list, and click `Invocations` or `Logs`.

### How to access logs locally

When [developing locally](/docs/guides/functions/local-development) you will see error messages and console log statements printed to your local terminal window.

### How to use logs

- **Uncaught exceptions**: Uncaught exceptions thrown by a function during execution will be automatically logged, allowing you to view the error message and stack trace in the Logs tool.
- **Custom log events**: You can also use `console.log`, `console.error`, and `console.warn` in your code to emit custom log events. These events will also appear in the Logs tool. For example, you can use `console.log` to print the value of a variable, or `console.error` to report an unexpected condition.
- **Message length and event limits**: A custom log message can contain up to 10,000 characters. A function can log up to 100 events within a 10 second period.

Here is an example of how to use `console.log` in your function:

```
Deno.serve(async (_req) => {
  const { name } = await req.json()
  const data = {
    message: `Hello ${name}!`,
  }

  console.log(`Name: ${name}`)

  return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } })
})
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problems or issues with your Edge Functions, here are some tips and steps to help you resolve them.

### Unable to deploy Edge Function

- Make sure you're on the latest version of the [Supabase CLI](/docs/guides/cli#updates).
- Run the deploy command with the `-debug` flag. This flag will show more details and information about the deployment process and any errors that may occur.
- Run the deploy command with the `-legacy-bundle` flag. This flag will use a different bundling method that may work better for some functions.
- If the output from the commands above does not help you to resolve the issue, open a support ticket via the Supabase Dashboard (by clicking the "Help" button at the top right) and include all output from the commands mentioned above.

### Unable to call Edge Function

If you’re unable to call your Edge Function or are experiencing any CORS issues:

- Make sure you followed the [CORS guide](/docs/guides/functions/cors). This guide explains how to enable and configure CORS for your Edge Functions, and how to avoid common pitfalls and errors.
- Check your function logs. Navigate to the [Functions section](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/functions) in your dashboard, select your function from the list, and click `Logs`. Check for any errors or warnings that may indicate the cause of the problem.

There are two debugging tools available: Invocations and Logs. Invocations shows the Request and Response for each execution, while Logs shows any platform events, including deployments and errors.

### Edge Function takes too long to respond

If your Edge Function takes too long to respond or times out:

- Navigate to the [Functions section](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/functions) in your dashboard, select your function from the list, and click `Logs`.
- In the logs, look for the `booted` event and check if they have consistent boot times.
  - If the boot times are similar, it’s likely an issue with your function’s code, such as a large dependency, a slow API call, or a complex computation. You can try to optimize your code, reduce the size of your dependencies, or use caching techniques to improve the performance of your function.
  - If only some of the `booted` events are slow, find the affected `region` in the metadata and submit a support request via the "Help" button at the top.

### Receiving 546 Error Response

The 546 error response may occur due to various reasons:

- **Memory or CPU Limits**: The function might have exhausted its memory or encountered CPU limits enforced during execution.
- **Syntax Issues**: In rare cases, the error may result from syntax issues in the function, leading to a failure in execution. Ensure that the function syntax is correct. Refer to [Edge Functions examples](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples/edge-functions) for guidance.
- **Event Loop Completion**: If you observe "Event loop completed" in your error logs, it's likely your function is not implemented correctly. You should check your function code for any syntax errors, infinite loops, or unresolved promises that might cause this error. Or you can try running the function locally (using Supabase CLI **`functions serve`**) to see if you can debug the error. The local console should give a full stack trace on the error with line numbers of the source code.

### Issues serving Edge Functions locally with the Supabase CLI

- Make sure you're on the latest version of the [Supabase CLI](/docs/guides/cli#updates).
- Run the serve command with the `-debug` flag.
- Support engineers can then try to run the provided sample code locally and see if they can reproduce the issue.
- Search the [Edge Runtime](https://github.com/supabase/edge-runtime) and [CLI](https://github.com/supabase/cli) repos for the error message, to see if it has been reported before.
- If the output from the commands above does not help you to resolve the issue, please open a support ticket via the Supabase Dashboard (by clicking the "Help" button at the top right) and include all output and details about your commands.

## Advanced techniques

### Monitoring Edge Function Resource Usage

To determine how much memory and CPU your edge function consumes, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the Supabase Dashboard.
- Go to **Edge Functions**.
- Select the specific function by clicking on its name.
- View the resource usage **Metrics** on the charts provided.

### Resource Allocation

Ensure your project has sufficient resources to handle the traffic. Under-provisioned resources can lead to HTTP timeouts and 5xx response codes. Monitor resource utilization through the Dashboard metrics and consider upgrading if necessary.

### Query and Index Optimization

Fine-tune your database queries and ensure proper indexing. Use `pg_stat_statements` to identify slow queries and optimize them to reduce load on the system.

### Configuring Edge Function Timeouts

Edge Functions are designed to execute custom logic close to your users, but they are subject to timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion. Ensure your function's execution time is within this limit and if timeouts persist, consider optimizing your function or breaking it into smaller, more efficient functions. You can refer to this guide if you want to read more about [timeouts](docs/guides/database/postgres/configuration).

### Understanding CPU Soft and Hard Limits

An isolate is like a worker that can handle multiple requests for a function. It works until a time limit of 400 seconds is reached. Now, there are two types of limits for the CPU.

1. **Soft Limit**: When the isolate hits the soft limit, it retires. This means it won't take on any new requests, but it will finish processing the ones it's already working on. It keeps going until it either hits the hard limit for CPU time or reaches the 400-second time limit, whichever comes first.
2. **Hard Limit**: If there are new requests after the soft limit is reached, a new isolate is created to handle them. The original isolate continues until it hits the hard limit or the time limit. This ensures that existing requests are completed, and new ones will be managed by a newly created isolate.

### Checking function boot time

Check the logs for the function. In the logs, look for a "Booted" event and note the reported boot time. If available, click on the event to access more details, including the regions from where the function was served. Investigate if the boot time is excessively high (longer than 1 second) and note any patterns or regions where it occurs. You can refer to this guide for troubleshooting [regional invocations](/docs/guides/functions/regional-invocation).

### Finding bundle size

To find the bundle size of a function, you can run the following command locally:

`1deno info /path/to/function/index.ts`

Look for the "size" field in the output which represents the approximate bundle size of the function. You can find the accurate bundle size when you deploy your function via Supabase CLI. If the function is part of a larger application, consider examining the bundle size of the specific function independently.

The source code of a function is subject to size limits:

- **Free Plan**: Maximum size limit of 2MB.
- **Pro Plan**: Increased limit of 10MB.

### Analyze dependencies

Run `deno info`, providing the path to your input map if you use one.
Review the dependencies listed in the output. Pay attention to any significantly large dependencies, as they can contribute to increased bundle size and potential boot time issues.
Examine if there are any unnecessary or redundant dependencies that can be removed. Check for outdated dependencies and update to the latest versions if possible.

```bash
deno info --import-map=/path/to/import_map.json /path/to/function/index.ts
```
