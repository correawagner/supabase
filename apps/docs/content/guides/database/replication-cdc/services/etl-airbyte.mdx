Airbyte has excellent [documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/postgres/) for setting up Postgresql as a source, either in their cloud offering or by self-hosting.

You can follow those steps with the following modifications:

1. Use the `postgres` user
2. Select `logical replication` as the replication method (`xmin` is possible, but not recommended)

## Troubleshootting

Airbyte has a known [issue](https://discuss.airbyte.io/t/postgres-source-replication-slot-safe-wal-size-only-reset-when-a-change-occurs/3263/7) where it does not clear WAL files on each successful sync. The recommended workaround is to have a `heartbeat` table that you write changes to once an hour.
