Fivetran has excellent [documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide) for setting up Postgresql as a source.

You can follow those steps with the following modifications:


1. In Step 2, choose `logical replication` as the sync mechanism
2. In Step 3, do not create a user and use the existing `postgres` user for replication 
3. In Step 5, no need to modify any WAL settings as we have done that for you
