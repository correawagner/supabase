Performing analytics, connecting external tools or expanding access are all tasks that you do not want to use your primary database for. In these scenarios, the most common options are:
1. Setting up a Read-Replica
2. Configuring Logical replication to send your data to a Data Warehouse

## Read Replicas

[Read-Replicas](/guides/platform/read-replicas) are available on Supabase and allow you to create a second database that is a direct, read-only copy of your primary database that stays in sync. This can be useful for many things, like load-balancing, and, in this case, for analytics workloads.

## Logical Replication

<Admonition type="warning">

Logical replication does work on the Supabase platform but it is not currently fully supported due to restricted access to certain Postgres settings.
Full support is in development and our Support team can help you in the meantime.

</Admonition>

Your use case might go beyond what a Read-Replica can offer and you may need to replicate your data from Supabase into a Data Warehouse, like Clickhouse or Google BigQuery. This could be because of long running queries, the amount of data or because you need to combine your Supabase data with data from other systems.

This is done using a method called [Logical Replication](/guides/database/logical-replication).

In most cases a tool, such as Estuary or Airbyte or Fivetran, will be used to susbscribe to your database, capture the changes and write them to a destination of your choice, ranging from S3 to  Google BigQuery to Google Sheets to Salesforce.

Regardless of the tool chosen, it is very likely that logical replication will be used at its core. To understand the process, we have an [introduction](/guides/database/replication-cdc/logical-replication), as well as an [FAQ](/guides/databae/replication-cdc/faq)

To learn how to configure Supabase with a specific tool, do the following:
1. Follow the steps in our [guide to setting up replication](/guides/database/postgres/setup-replicstion-external) to create a `publication` and a `replication slot`
2. Select a guide from the navigation menu
