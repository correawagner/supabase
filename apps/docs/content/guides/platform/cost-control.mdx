## Spend Cap
The Spend Cap determines whether your organization can exceed the subscription plan's free quota allowance for any metric. Scenarios that could lead to high usage—and thus high costs—include system attacks or bugs in your software. The Spend Cap can protect you from these unexpected costs for certain metrics.

### What happens when the Spend Cap is on?
After exceeding the free quota allowance for a metric, further usage of that metric is disallowed until the next billing cycle. You don't get charged for over-usage but your services will be restricted according to our [Fair Use Policy](/docs/guides/platform/billing-faq#fair-use-policy) if you consistently exceed the free quota allowance.

<Admonition type="note">
  Note that only certain metrics are covered by the Spend Cap. Metrics with predictable costs are excluded.
</Admonition>

### What happens when the Spend Cap is off?
Your projects will continue to operate after exceeding the free quota allowance for a metric. Any additional usage will be charged based on the metric's cost per unit, as outlined on the [pricing page](https://supabase.com/pricing).

<Admonition type="note">
  When the Spend Cap is off, we recommend monitoring your usage and costs on the [organization's usage page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/usage).

### What the Spend Cap is not
The Spend Cap doesn't allow for fine-grained cost control, such as setting budgets for specific metrics or receiving notifications when certain costs are reached. We plan to make cost control more flexible in the future.

### How to configure the Spend Cap
You can configure the Spend Cap when creating an organization on the Pro Plan or at any time in the Cost Control section of the [organization's billing page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/billing).

## How to keep track of your usage and costs
You can monitor your usage on the [organization's usage page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/usage). The Billing Breakdown section of the [organization's billing page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/billing) shows your current spending and provides an estimate of your total costs for the billing cycle based on your usage.
