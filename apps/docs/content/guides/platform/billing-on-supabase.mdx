## Subscription plans
Supabase offers different subscription plansâ€”Free, Pro, Team, and Enterprise. For a closer look at each plan's features and pricing, visit our [pricing page](https://supabase.com/pricing).

### Free Plan
The Free Plan helps you get started and explore the platform. You are granted two free projects. The project limit applies across all organizations where you are an Owner or Administrator. This means you could have two Free Plan organizations with one project each, or one Free Plan organization with two projects. Paused projects do not count towards your free project limit.

### Paid plans
Upgrading your organization to a paid plan provides additional features, and you receive a higher [usage quota](/docs/guides/platform/billing-on-supabase#usage-quota). You unlock the benefits of the paid plan for all projects within your organization - for example, no projects in your Pro Plan organization will be paused.

## Organization-based billing
Supabase bills separately for each organization. That means that each organization has its own subscription, including a unique subscription plan (Free, Pro, Team, or Enterprise), payment method, billing cycle, and invoices.

Different plans cannot be mixed within a single organization. For example, you cannot have both a Pro Plan project and a Free Plan project in the same organization. To have projects on different plans, you must create separate organizations. See [Project Transfers](/docs/guides/platform/project-transfer) if you need to move a project to a different organization.

## Usage quota
Each subscription plan includes a built-in quota for some selected usage items, such as [Egress](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/egress), [Storage Size](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size), or [Edge Function Invocations](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/edge-function-invocations). This quota represents your free usage allowance. If you stay within it, you incur no extra charges for these items. Only usage beyond the quota is billed as overage.

For usage items without a quota, such as [Compute](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/compute) or [Custom Domains](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/custom-domains), you are charged for your entire usage.

The quota is applied to your entire organization, independent of how many projects you launch within that organization. For billing purposes, we sum the usage across all projects in a monthly invoice.
