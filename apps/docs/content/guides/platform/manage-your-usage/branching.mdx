## What you are charged for
Each [Preview branch](/docs/guides/deployment/branching) is a separate environment with all Supabase services (Database, Auth, Storage, etc.). You're charged for usage within that environment—such as [Compute](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/compute), Disk Size, Egress, and Storage—just like the project you branched from.

Usage by Preview branches counts toward your subscription plan's free quota.

## How charges are calculated
Refer to individual [usage items](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage) for details on how charges are calculated. Branching charges are the sum of all these items.

### Branching usage on your invoice
Compute incurred by Preview branches is shown as "Branching Compute Hours" on your invoice. Other usage items are not shown separately for branches.

## Pricing
There is no fixed fee for a Preview branch. You only pay for the usage it incurs. With Compute costs of $0.01344 per hour, a branch running on Micro Compute size starts at $0.32 per day.

## Billing examples
The project has a Preview branch "XYZ", that runs for 30 hours, incurring Compute and Egress costs. Disk Size usage remains within the 8 GB included in the subscription plan, so no additional charges apply.

## Optimize Branching usage
- Merge Preview branches as soon as they are ready
- Delete Preview branches that are no longer in use
- Check whether your [persistent branches](/docs/guides/deployment/branching#persistent-branches) need to be defined as persistent, or if they can be ephemeral instead. Persistent branches will remain active even after the underlying PR is closed.
