Since [v1.171.0](https://github.com/supabase/cli/releases/tag/v1.171.0) the Supabase CLI supports debugging Edge Functions via the v8 inspector protocol, allowing for debugging via Chrome DevTools, VS Code, and IntelliJ IDEA for example.

### Inspect with Chrome Developer Tools

You can use the [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) to set breakpoints and inspect the execution of your Edge Functions.

1. Serve your functions in [inspect mode](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-functions-serve): `supabase functions serve --inspect-mode brk`. This will set a breakpoint at the first line to pause script execution before any code runs.
1. In your Chrome browser navigate to `chrome://inspect`.
1. Click the "Configure..."" button to the right of the Discover network targets checkbox.
1. In the Target discovery settings dialog box that opens, enter `127.0.0.1:8083` in the blank space and click the "Done" button to exit the dialog box.
1. Click "Open dedicated DevTools for Node" to complete the preparation for debugging. The opened DevTools window will now listen to any incoming requests to edge-runtime.
1. Send a request to your function running locally, e.g. via curl or Postman. The DevTools window will now pause script execution at first line.
1. In the "Sources" tab navigate to `file://` > `home/deno/functions/<your-function-name>/index.ts`.
1. Use the DevTools to set breakpoints and inspect the execution of your Edge Function.

### Debug with VS Code

To setup VS Code for breakpoint debugging in your Worker project:

1. Create a .vscode folder in your project's root folder if one does not exist.
1. Within that folder, create a launch.json file with the following content:

```json
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Supabase Edge",
      "type": "node",
      "address": "127.0.0.1",
      "request": "attach",
      "localRoot": "/",
      "remoteRoot": "/",
      "timeout": 1000000,

      // Properties below are optional.
      "restart": true,

      // Inspector is accepting sessions on 9229 by default. If you changed the listening port
      // via the inspector flag above, this value must also be changed.
      "port": 8083
    }
  ]
}
```

1. Open your project in VS Code, open a new terminal window from VS Code, and run `supabase functions serve --inspect` to start the local dev server.
1. At the top of the Run & Debug panel, you should see an option to select a configuration. Choose "Supabase Edge", and select the play icon.
1. Go back to a .js or .ts file in your project and add at least one breakpoint.
1. Send a request to your function running locally, e.g. via curl or Postman.

### Debug with IntelliJ IDEA

Refer to the official [IntelliJ IDEA documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-and-debugging-node-js.html#ws_node_debug_remote_tcp) for instructions on how to set up a debug configuration for your project.
