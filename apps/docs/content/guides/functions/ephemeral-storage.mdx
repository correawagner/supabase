Edge Functions provides ephemeral file storage. You can read and write files to `/tmp` directory.

Ephemeral storage will reset on each function invocation. This means the files you write during an invocation can only be read only within the same invocation.

### Use cases

Here are some use cases where ephemeral storage can be useful:

- Unzip an archive of CSVs and then add them as records to the DB
- Custom image manipulation workflows (using [MagickWasm](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/examples/image-manipulation))

Tip: You can use [Background Tasks](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/background-tasks) to handle slow file processing outside of a request.

### How to use

You can use [Deno File System APIs](https://docs.deno.com/api/deno/file-system) or [`node:fs` module](https://docs.deno.com/api/node/fs/) to access the `/tmp` path.

### Example

Here is an example on how to write a zip file a user uploaded into a temproary file for further processing.

```
Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  if (req.headers.get("content-type") !== "application/zip") {
    return new Response(
      "file must be a zip file",
      {
        status: 400,
      },
    );
  }

  const uploadId = crypto.randomUUID();
  await Deno.writeFile("/tmp/" + uploadId, req.body);

  // do something with the written zip file

  return new Response('ok')
})
```

### Unavailable APIs

Currently, the synchronous APIs (eg: `Deno.writeFileSync` or `Deno.mkdirSync`) for creating or writing files are not supported.

You can use sync variations of read APIs (eg: `Deno.readFileSync`).

### Limits

In the hosted platform, a free project can write up to 256MB of data to ephemeral storage. A paid project can write up to 512MB.
