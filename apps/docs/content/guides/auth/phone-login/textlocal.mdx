## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **A Textlocal account**: Sign up [here](https://www.textlocal.com/signup) to start sending SMS.
- **A Supabase project**: Necessary for SMS authentication integration. Create your project [here](https://supabase.com/dashboard).
- **A mobile phone**: To receive SMS, verifying the setup and functionality.
- **DLT Registration**: Required for businesses in India, as per TRAI regulations, to send commercial SMS.

## DLT Registration Requirements for India

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) mandates that all businesses intending to send commercial SMS in India must register their business entity, headers (sender names), and message templates on DLT platforms. This step is essential for legally and effectively sending SMS within India, ensuring compliance with TRAI regulations.

1. **Complete your DLT registration**: Visit [this link](https://www.textlocal.in/tcccpr-trai-new-dlt-registration/) for a detailed guide on registering your business on a DLT platform.
2. **Update your Textlocal account**: After receiving your Entity ID/Registration ID from the DLT registration, update it in your Textlocal account settings [here](https://control.textlocal.in/settings/account/).
3. **Approval confirmation**: Share a screenshot showing your approved headers from the DLT platform with Textlocal support at support@textlocal.in to activate your SMS services.

## Setting Up Textlocal as Your SMS Provider

To integrate Textlocal with Supabase, you'll need:

- **API Key**: For API authentication.
- **Sender Name**: The name displayed as the SMS sender.
- **Supabase Configuration**: Steps to integrate with your Supabase project.

### Acquire Your Textlocal API Key

First, log into your Textlocal account and head to the API Keys section under Settings. Here, generate a new API Key. This key will facilitate secure communication between your application and Textlocal's SMS gateway.

### Setting a Custom Sender Name (Optional)

Textlocal defaults to 'TXTLCL' as the sender name for all messages. However, customizing this to reflect your brand can enhance communication trustworthiness. To change it, navigate in your Textlocal dashboard: **Settings > All Settings > Sender Names**. Here, you can create and apply a sender name that aligns with your brand, adding a personalized touch to your messages.

### Integrating with Supabase

To set up Textlocal as your SMS provider in Supabase, follow these steps:

1. **Access Supabase Dashboard**: Navigate to your Supabase project dashboard.
2. **Authentication Providers**: Go to **Auth > Providers** or directly access the settings [here](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers).
3. **Select Phone Provider**: From the list of available authentication providers, choose "Phone".
4. **Enable Phone Authentication**: Toggle the option to enable the Phone provider.
5. **Enter Textlocal Details**: Input your Textlocal API Key and Sender Name into the corresponding Supabase fields.

#### Customize Your SMS Template

Customize the OTP SMS template for branding or to include specific instructions. Use the `.Code` variable to insert the OTP.
