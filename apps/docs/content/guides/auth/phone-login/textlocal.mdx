## Prerequisites

You will need:

<Admonition type="note">

TextLocal operates regional websites, so the signup URL may vary based on your location.

</Admonition>

- A TextLocal account (sign up [here](https://www.textlocal.com/signup)).
- A Supabase project (create one [here](https://supabase.com/dashboard)).
- A mobile phone capable of receiving SMS.

## Set up TextLocal as your SMS provider

You will need the following information to proceed:

- API Key
- Sender Name (This is the name that will appear as the sender of the SMS)
- Configure Supabase

### Getting your TextLocal API Key

After logging into your TextLocal account, proceed to Settings > API Keys. Here, you'll want to create a new API Key that we will be using for our setup.

### Getting a sender name (optional)

TextLocal assigns a default sender name, 'TXTLCL', for all outgoing messages. However, for a touch of personalization relevant to your application, you can create your own sender name. Simply navigate to Settings > All Settings > Sender Names within your TextLocal account to set up a sender name that better aligns with your brand identity.

### Configure Supabase

Next, go to the [Auth > Providers](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers) page on the Supabase dashboard and select "Phone" from the list of Auth Providers.

You should see an option to enable the Phone provider.

Toggle it on, and copy the API key and Sender values over from the Testlocal dashboard.

#### Custom SMS template

You have the option to customize the SMS message that is sent with the OTP code. This can be helpful for branding purposes or when you need to include specific instructions or a website URL.

Utilize the `.Code` variable within your template to display the OTP code.
