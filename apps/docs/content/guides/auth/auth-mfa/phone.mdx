## What is Phone MFA

Phone MFA involves a code generated by Supabase Auth which is delivered via messaging, such as SMS or WhatsApp.
At present, MFA is available as part of the Auth Advanced MFA Add-on and costs $70 USD/month.

## Add Phone enrollment flow

An enrollment flow provides a UI for users to set up additional authentication factors. Most applications add the enrollment flow in two places within their app:

1. Right after login or sign up.
   This lets users quickly set up MFA immediately after they log in or create an
   account. We recommend encouraging all users to set up MFA if that makes sense
   for your application. Many applications offer this as an opt-in step in an
   effort to reduce onboarding friction.
2. From within a settings page.
   Allows users to set up, disable or modify their MFA settings.

We recommend building one generic flow that you can reuse in both cases with minor modifications.

Enrolling a factor for use with MFA takes three steps:

1. Call `supabase.auth.mfa.enroll()`.
2. Calling the `supabase.auth.mfa.challenge()` API. This sends a code via SMS or WhatsApp and prepares Supabase Auth to accept a verification code from the user.
3. Calling the `supabase.auth.mfa.verify()` API. `supabase.auth.mfa.challenge()` returns a challenge ID.
   This verifies that the code issued by Supabase Auth matches the code input by the user. If the verification succeeds, the factor
   immediately becomes active for the user account. If not, you should repeat
   steps 2 and 3.

You will need to set up a valid phone provider, such as `twilio` or `vonage`, to use the MFA (Phone). Twilio Verify is not supported at this time. Alternatively, you can use the Send SMS Hook.

#### Example: React

Below is an example that creates a new `EnrollMFA` component that illustrates the important pieces of the MFA enrollment flow.

- When the component appears on screen, the `supabase.auth.mfa.enroll()` API is
  called once to start the process of enrolling a new factor for the current
  user.
- A challenge is created using the `supabase.auth.mfa.challenge()` API and the
  code from the user is submitted for verification using the
  `supabase.auth.mfa.verify()` challenge.
- `onEnabled` is a callback that notifies the other components that enrollment
  has completed.
- `onCancelled` is a callback that notifies the other components that the user
  has clicked the `Cancel` button.

```tsx
export function EnrollMFA({
  onEnrolled,
  onCancelled,
}: {
  onEnrolled: () => void
  onCancelled: () => void
}) {
  const [phoneNumber, setPhoneNumber] = useState('')
  const [factorId, setFactorId] = useState('')
  const [verifyCode, setVerifyCode] = useState('')
  const [error, setError] = useState('')
  const [challengeId, setChallengeId] = useState('')

  const onEnableClicked = () => {
    // Enroll and Challenge
    setError('')
    ;(async () => {
      const verify = await auth.mfa.verify({
        factorId,
        challengeId,
        code: verifyCode,
      })
      if (verify.error) {
        setError(verify.error.message)
        throw verify.error
      }

      onEnrolled()
    })()
  }
  const onEnrollClicked = async () => {
    setError('')
    try {
      // TODO: remove friendly name
      const factor = await auth.mfa.enroll({
        phone: phoneNumber,
        factorType: 'phone',
        friendlyName: 'test',
      })
      if (factor.error) {
        setError(factor.error.message)
        throw factor.error
      }

      setFactorId(factor.data.id)
    } catch (error) {
      setError('Failed to Enroll the Factor.')
    }
  }

  const onSendOTPClicked = async () => {
    setError('')
    try {
      const challenge = await auth.mfa.challenge({ factorId })
      if (challenge.error) {
        setError(challenge.error.message)
        throw challenge.error
      }

      setChallengeId(challenge.data.id)
    } catch (error) {
      setError('Failed to resend the code.')
    }
  }

  return (
    <>
      {error && <div className="error">{error}</div>}
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Phone Number"
        value={phoneNumber}
        onChange={(e) => setPhoneNumber(e.target.value.trim())}
      />
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Verification Code"
        value={verifyCode}
        onChange={(e) => setVerifyCode(e.target.value.trim())}
      />
      <input type="button" value="Enroll" onClick={onEnrollClicked} />
      <input type="button" value="Submit Code" onClick={onEnableClicked} />
      <input type="button" value="Send OTP Code" onClick={onSendOTPClicked} />
      <input type="button" value="Cancel" onClick={onCancelled} />
    </>
  )
}
```

### Add unenrollment flow

An unenrollment flow provides a UI for users to manage and unenroll factors linked to their accounts. Most applications do so via a factor management page where users can view and unlink selected factors.

When a user unenrolls a factor, call `supabase.auth.mfa.unenroll()` with the ID of the factor. For example, call `supabase.auth.mfa.unenroll({factorId: "d30fd651-184e-4748-a928-0a4b9be1d429"})` to unenroll a factor with ID `d30fd651-184e-4748-a928-0a4b9be1d429`.

#### Example: React

Below is an example that creates a new `UnenrollMFA` component that illustrates the important pieces of the MFA enrollment flow. Note that users can only unenroll a factor after completing the enrollment flow and obtaining an `aal2` JWT claim. Here are some points of note:

- When the component appears on screen, the `supabase.auth.mfa.listFactors()` endpoint
  fetches all existing factors together with their details.
- The existing factors for a user are displayed in a table.
- Once the user has selected a factor to unenroll, they can type in the factorId and click **Unenroll**
  which creates a confirmation modal.

<Admonition type="note">

Unenrolling a factor will downgrade the assurance level from `aal2` to `aal1` only after the refresh interval has lapsed. For an immediate downgrade from `aal2` to `aal1` after enrolling one will need to manually call `refreshSession()`

</Admonition>

```tsx
/**
 * UnenrollMFA shows a simple table with the list of factors together with a button to unenroll.
 * When a user types in the factorId of the factor that they wish to unenroll and clicks unenroll
 * the corresponding factor will be unenrolled.
 */
export function UnenrollMFA() {
  const [factorId, setFactorId] = useState('')
  const [factors, setFactors] = useState([])
  const [error, setError] = useState('') // holds an error message

  useEffect(() => {
    ;(async () => {
      try {
        const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.mfa.listFactors()
        if (error) {
          throw error
        }

        // Combine the phone and totp factors into a single array
        const combinedFactors = [...data.phone, ...data.totp]

        setFactors(combinedFactors)
      } catch (error) {
        setError('Failed to fetch MFA factors.')
      }
    })()
  }, [])

  const onUnenrollClicked = async () => {
    try {
      const { error } = await supabase.auth.mfa.unenroll({ factorId })
      if (error) {
        setError(error.message)
        return
      }

      // Remove the unenrolled factor from the list
      setFactors(factors.filter((factor) => factor.id !== factorId))
      setFactorId('')
    } catch (error) {
      setError('Failed to unenroll MFA factor.')
    }
  }

  return (
    <>
      {error && <div className="error">{error}</div>}
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Factor ID</th>
            <th>Friendly Name</th>
            <th>Factor Type</th>
            <th>Factor Status</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {factors.map((factor) => (
            <tr key={factor.id}>
              <td>{factor.id}</td>
              <td>{factor.friendly_name}</td>
              <td>{factor.factor_type}</td>
              <td>{factor.status}</td>
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Enter Factor ID to Unenroll"
        value={factorId}
        onChange={(e) => setFactorId(e.target.value.trim())}
      />
      <button onClick={onUnenrollClicked}>Unenroll</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

#### Example: React

Adding the challenge step to login depends heavily on the architecture of your app. However, a fairly common way to structure React apps is to have a large component (often named `App`) which contains most of the authenticated application logic.

This example will wrap this component with logic that will show an MFA challenge screen if necessary, before showing the full application. This is illustrated in the `AppWithMFA` example below.

```tsx
function AppWithMFA() {
  const [readyToShow, setReadyToShow] = useState(false)
  const [showMFAScreen, setShowMFAScreen] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    ;(async () => {
      try {
        const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.mfa.getAuthenticatorAssuranceLevel()
        if (error) {
          throw error
        }

        console.log(data)

        if (data.nextLevel === 'aal2' && data.nextLevel !== data.currentLevel) {
          setShowMFAScreen(true)
        }
      } finally {
        setReadyToShow(true)
      }
    })()
  }, [])

  if (readyToShow) {
    if (showMFAScreen) {
      return <AuthMFA />
    }

    return <App />
  }

  return <></>
}
```

- `supabase.auth.mfa.getAuthenticatorAssuranceLevel()` does return a promise.
  Don't worry, this is a very fast method (microseconds) as it rarely uses the
  network.
- `readyToShow` only makes sure the AAL check completes before showing any
  application UI to the user.
- If the current level can be upgraded to the next one, the MFA screen is
  shown.
- Once the challenge is successful, the `App` component is finally rendered on
  screen.
