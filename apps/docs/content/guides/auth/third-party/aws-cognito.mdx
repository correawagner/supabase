AWS Cognito User Pools (via AWS Amplify or on its own) can be used as a third-party authentication provider alongside Supabase Auth, or standalone, with your Supabase project.

## Getting started

1. First you need to add an integration to connect your Supabas eproject with your AWS Cognito User Pool. You will need the pool's ID and region.
2. Add a new Third-party Auth integration in your project's [Authentication settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/auth).
3. Assign the `role: 'authenticated'` custom claim to all JWTs by using a Pre-Token Generation Trigger.
4. Finally setup the Supabase client in your application.

  accessToken: async () => {
    const tokens = await fetchAuthSession()

    // Alternatively you can use tokens?.idToken instead.
    return tokens?.accessToken
  },
})

## Use a Pre-Token Generation Trigger to assign the authenticated role

Your Supabase project inspects the `role` claim present in all JWTs sent to it, to assign the correct Postgres role when using the Data API, Storage or Realtime authorization.

By default, AWS Cognito JWTs (both ID token and access tokens) do not contain a `role` claim in them. If you were to send such a JWT to your Supabase project, the `anon` role would be assigned when executing the Postgres query. Most of your app's logic will be accessible by the `authenticated` role.

A recommended approach to do this is to configure a [Pre-Token Generation Trigger](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-pre-token-generation.html) either `V1_0` (ID token only) or `V2_0` (both access and ID token). To do this you will need to create a new Lambda function (in any language and runtime) and assign it to the [AWS Cognito User Pool's Lambda Triggers configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html). For example, the Lambda function should look similar to this:

        role: 'authenticated',
      },
    },
  }

  return event
}
```
