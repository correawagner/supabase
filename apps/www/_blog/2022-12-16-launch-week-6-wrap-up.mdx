That's a wrap on Supabase Launch Week Day 6. Here's everything we shipped in one long blog post.

## Monday - New Docs, built with Next.js

For a developer tool, documentation is more than a resource - it's part of the product. For the past two years at Supabase, this part of our product hasn't been great. Our new docs, built with Next.js, feature a completely new design, better navigation, and the promise of a fully-integrated experience.
