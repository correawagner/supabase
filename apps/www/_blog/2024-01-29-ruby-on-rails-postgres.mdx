Every Supabase project comes with a full [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database, a free and open source database which is considered one of the world's most stable and advanced databases.

Postgres is an ideal choice for your Ruby on Rails applications as Rails ships with a built-in Postgres adapter!

In this post we'll start from scratch, creating a new Rails project, connecting it to our Supabase Postgres database, and interacting with the database using the Rails Console.

<Admonition type="note" label="Need help migrating?">

Supabase is one of the best [free alternatives to Heroku Postgres](/alternatives/supabase-vs-heroku-postgres). See [this guide](/docs/guides/resources/migrating-to-supabase/heroku) to learn how to migrate from Heroku to Supabase.

There's also a [Heroku to Supabase migration tool](https://migrate.supabase.com/) available to migrate in just a few clicks.

## Create a Rails Project

Make sure your Ruby and Rails versions are up to date, then use `rails new` to scaffold a new Rails project. Use the `-d=postgresql` flag to set it up for Postgres.

Go to the [Rails docs](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) for more details.

```bash Terminal
rails new blog -d=postgresql
```

## Set up the Postgres connection details

Go to [database.new](https://database.new) and create a new Supabase project. Save your database password securely.

When your project is up and running, navigate to the [database settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database) to find the URI connection string.

Rails ships with a Postgres adapter included, you can simply configure it via the environment variables. You can find the database URL in your [Supabase Dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/settings/database).

```bash Terminal
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres.xxxx:password@xxxx.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

## Create and run a database migration

Rails includes Active Record as the ORM as well as database migration tooling which generates the SQL migration files for you.

Create an example `Article` model and generate the migration files.

```bash Terminal
bin/rails generate model Article title:string body:text
bin/rails db:migrate
```

## Use the Model to interact with the database

You can use the included Rails console to interact with the database. For example, you can create new entries or list all entries in a Model's table.

```bash Terminal
bin/rails console
```

```rb irb
article = Article.new(title: "Hello Rails", body: "I am on Rails!")
article.save # Saves the entry to the database

Article.all
```

## Start the app

```bash Terminal
bin/rails server
```

Run the development server. Go to http://127.0.0.1:3000 in a browser to see your application running.

## Conclusion

Supabase is the ideal platform for powering your Postgres database for your Ruby on Rails applications! Every Supabase project comes with a full Postgres database and a good number of [useful extension](/docs/guides/database/extensions)!
