This launch week was unique. We had so much content that we decided to do a “main stage”, with five major features, and a “build stage” with additional content. It's a lot to digest, so here are 10 of my favorites.

## Cool things from the community

I also wanted to highlight a few thing that happened in the community over the past few weeks:

### Local AI Stack with Yoko from a16z

I caught up with [Yoko](https://twitter.com/stuffyokodraws) from Andresson Horowitz to chat about the [Local AI stack](https://github.com/ykhli/local-ai-stack) that she developed with Supabase, Ollama, Langchain, and Next.js.

  />

### OpenBB **Didier Lopes, the CEO of OpenBB**

Didier explained the origins of [OpenBB Terminal](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal), the first financial terminal that is free and fully open source. He shared some details about the integration that he's building with Supabase.

### Offline sync with ElectricSQL

Offline sync is one of the most requested features for Supabase. I caught up with the team at ElectricSQL to learn more about their [integration](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/electricsql).

### Basejump is like “shadcn for Supabase”

In the past few months, [Tiniscule](https://twitter.com/tiniscule) has been quietly upgrading the [Basejump](https://usebasejump.com/) starter kit for Supabase. I think of it a bit like [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for Supabase - super easy to template out a secure, scalable enterprise app. Along the way he's been developing periphery tooling like [test helpers](https://github.com/usebasejump/supabase-test-helpers), and pushing us to provide better primitives. One of our most common questions is “accounts and permissions?”. [Basejump](https://usebasejump.com) solves that and more.

### Mockup madness from tldraw

Oh, and the [tldraw](https://www.tldraw.com/) team have been on an [absolute tear this week](https://twitter.com/tldraw/status/1734624421623521719):
