Today, Supabase is releasing Log Drains for all Team and Enterprise customers in Public Alpha.

With Log Drains, customers can now export the logs generated by their Supabase products to external destinations, such as Datadog or custom HTTP endpoints. Logs generated by all Supabase products such as the Database, Storage, Realtime and Auth are supported.

Beyond providing a single pane of glass inside your existing logging and monitoring system, Log Drains can be used to build additional alerting and observability pipelines. For example, you can ingest Postgres connection logs into your Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to create custom alerting rules based on events happening in your database.

This feature is also beneficial for supporting extended retention periods to meet compliance requirements.

While we continue to improve logging and alerting within the Supabase platform, Log Drains provide an important escape hatch for these advanced use cases today.

## How do Log Drains work?

Log Drains is built off the Logflare server, which is the analytics and observability server of the Supabase stack. To meet the requirements of log drains, the team performed an architecture overhaul to allow for log events ingested into the pipeline to be dispatched off to many different destinations concurrently.

This event dispatching is performed at ingestion time, meaning that the log drain destination will receive events at the same speed as it will appear in the platform dashboard â€” nearly realtime.

## What are the available destinations?

Log drains can be set up in the project settings.

</div>

The initial supported destinations are:

- HTTP Endpoint
- Datadog Logs

For example, we could send a project's logs to an edge function via the HTTP Endpoint drain and perform some processing, such as filtering or key remapping, before dispatching them off to an external provider. In the following example, we perform a simple `console.log` of the received JSON payload.

Certain SaaS providers will be supported out of the box, such as Datadog Logs:

Setup guides are available within the [log drains documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/log-drains), with example walkthroughs for common use cases.

When self-hosting or during local development, log drains are available through the Studio and can be created and configured under Project Settings > Log Drains.
This feature will require the Supabase Analytics server, Logflare, to be included in the stack. Instructions for setting up and configuring the self-hosted Analytics server can be found in the [self-hosting documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/self-hosting-analytics/introduction).

## Pricing

Log Drains are available as an project Add-On for all Team and Enterprise customers. Each Log Drain costs $60 per month per project, with a $0.20 per million log events processing fee and a $0.09 per GB egress fee as part of unified egress.

## Roadmap

- We intend to support a wide variety of destinations. Syslog and Loki are currently under development and are expected to be released in the coming weeks. If you would like your favorite tools supported as a destination, vote on [this Github discussion](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/28324)!
- Sharing Log Drains between multiple projects
- Log sampling to control the volume of logs sent to the drain
- Draining specific product logs
