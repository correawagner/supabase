Python libs are now officially supported in Supabase.

## Enabled HTTP2 by default

Supabase clients will automatically use HTTP 2.0 when available by default, offering a seamless performance boost to your existing applications.

This improvement is implemented in a completely transparent way, and requires no changes to your existing code, while potentially delivering significant latency reduction and performance enhancements.

- https://github.com/supabase-community/postgrest-py/pull/462
- https://github.com/supabase-community/storage-py/pull/271

## Follow redirects by default

Supabase clients now automatically follow all HTTP redirects by default, aligning with the behavior of Supabase clients in other programming languages.

This enhancement improves consistency across the ecosystem and simplifies the handling of redirects, reducing the need for manual intervention in common scenarios like URL changes or load balancing.

- https://github.com/supabase-community/auth-py/pull/511

## Keep-alive enabled by default

Supabase clients now automatically include a `keep-alive` HTTP header by default, that was sometimes missing, addressing this inconsistency in previous versions.

This enhancement optimizes connection management, potentially reducing latency, and improving performance by maintaining persistent connections with the server, especially beneficial for applications making very frequent API calls.

## Edge Functions Regions

Added support for specifying the region that the edge function will run on (a region is basically a physical location in the world).

## Realtime V2

Realtime has been upgraded to version `2.0` with lots of improvements and fixes, including updated examples and the new Presence-related features (broadcast, subscribe, track, etc).

See also:

- https://github.com/supabase/realtime-py/pull/139
- https://github.com/supabase/realtime-py/pull/178

## Auth improvements

Anonymous logins have been added to the Auth client, including a new `is_anonymous` boolean property that has been added to the class `User`, also `sign_in_with_id_token()` and `sign_in_with_sso()` methods have been added to the Auth Client, among a lot of other bug fixes.

## Postgrest quoting/escaping in queries

Supabase improved PostgreSQL query safety by implementing `sanitize_param()` for parameter sanitization in internal SQL queries on the client-side, ensuring more secure data handling and query execution across all operations.

## Running with unverified SSL

Some users need to run the Supabase clients with invalid or unverified SSL for whatever reason (SSL debuggers/tracers/profilers/etc in development environments), a new optional boolean argument was added to the constructors of the clients, then passing `verify=False` enables it to run with unverified SSL without warnings.

```python
from postgrest import SyncPostgrestClient

url: str = "https://example.com"
h: dict = {"Custom-Header": "value"}

with SyncPostgrestClient(url, schema="pub", headers=h, verify = False) as client:
    session = client.session
    assert session.base_url == "https://example.com"

```

## Close socket in Realtime

The Supabase Realtime library now includes a new `close()` method for closing the socket connections.

This addition provides developers with finer control over the connection lifecycle, allowing explicit closing of the socket connections when needed.

```python
import os
from realtime import AsyncRealtimeClient

def callback1(payload):
    print("Callback 1: ", payload)

SUPABASE_ID: str = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_ID")
API_KEY: str = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_KEY")

URL: str = f"wss://{SUPABASE_ID}.supabase.co/realtime/v1/websocket"

client = AsyncRealtimeClient(URL, API_KEY)
await client.connect()

channel_1 = s.channel("realtime:public:sample")
channel_1.subscribe().on_postgres_changes("INSERT", callback1)

await client.listen()
await client.close()
```

## Edge Functions timeouts

Timeouts for Edge Functions are now fixed and long-running functions finish correctly, there is no longer a library client-side internal timeout cutting off the functions.

Users can now confidently implement more complex operations in Edge Functions.

```python
import os
from supabase import create_client
from supabase.lib.client_options import ClientOptions

url: str = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_URL")
key: str = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_KEY")

options = ClientOptions(function_client_timeout = 15)
client = create_client(url, key, options)

client.functions.url = "http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/hello-world"
print(client.functions.invoke("hello"))

```

## New tool Vec2pg to migrate data to Supabase

A new simple and extensible CLI tool to migrate vector data from other services and SASS into Supabase was created, it can migrate vector data from Pinecone and Qdrant into Supabase with a single command, streamlining workflows and enhancing data portability across AI and ML projects.

You can vote for other vector database providers to be added in the future!
