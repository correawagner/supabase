Database Webhooks allow you to send real-time data from your database to another system whenever a table event occurs.

:::note

Database Webhooks were previously known as Function Hooks.

:::

You can hook into three table events: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. All events are fired _after_ a database row is changed.

Database Webhooks are very similar to triggers, and that's because Database Webhooks are just a convenience wrapper around triggers
using the [pg_net](/docs/guides/database/extensions/pgnet) extension. This extension is asynchronous, and therefore will not block your database changes for long-running network requests.

This video demonstrates how you can create a new customer in Stripe each time a row is inserted into a `profiles` table:

<div class="video-container">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/codAs9-NeHM"
    frameBorder="1"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

## Creating a webhook

1. Navigate to the Database page in the Dashboard.
2. Click on the "Database Webhooks" link in the sidebar. Enable Webhooks, if it is not already enabled.
3. Click "Create Webhook".
4. Give your Webhook a name.
5. Select the table you want to hook into.
6. Select one or more events you want to hook into: table inserts, updates, or deletes.

We currently support HTTP webhooks. These will be sent as a `POST` request with a JSON payload.

## Payload

The payload is automatically generated from the underlying table record:

```typescript
type InsertPayload = {
  type: 'INSERT'
  table: string
  schema: string
  record: TableRecord<T>
  old_record: null
}
type UpdatePayload = {
  type: 'UPDATE'
  table: string
  schema: string
  record: TableRecord<T>
  old_record: TableRecord<T>
}
type DeletePayload = {
  type: 'DELETE'
  table: string
  schema: string
  record: null
  old_record: TableRecord<T>
}
```
