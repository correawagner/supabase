This guide steps through using Supa Fetcher integrated with Supabase.

If you donâ€™t have a Supa Fetcher account, create one [here](https://supafetcher.com/sign-up).

## Step 1: Create a Supabase project

If you already have your desired project you can skip this step.

From the [Supabase dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/), click `New project` and select an organization.

Fill in the required fields with your desired inputs and create.

Supabase will take a couple of minutes to configure the infrastructure.

## Step 2: Authorize Access

From your [Supa Fetcher account](https://supafetcher.com/app).

Add your `Project URL` to the `Authorize Supa Fetcher` section.

Add your `Project Service Role Key` to the `Authorize Supa Fetcher` section.

> This info can be found in your `Project Settings` in your Supabase Org.

Build your request to any API endpoint you wish to pull data from.
