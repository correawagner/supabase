This guide steps through using SupabaseForms integrated with Supabase.

If you donâ€™t have a SupabaseForms account, create one [here](https://supabaseforms.com/sign-up).

## Step 1: Create a Supabase project

If you already have your desired project you can skip this step.

From the [Supabase dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/), click `New project` and select an organization.

Fill in the required fields with your desired inputs and create.

Supabase will take a couple of minutes to configure the infrastructure.

## Step 2: Authorize Access

From your [SupabaseForms account](https://supabaseforms.com/home).

Add your `Project URL` to the `Authorize` section.

Add your `Project Anon Key` to the `Authorize` section.

> This info can be found in your `Project Settings` in your Supabase Org.

## Step 3: Create a Form

Select your Supabase table. Each column will be turned into an input field.

Customize it by requiring certain fields, exculding fields, changing field labels, etc.

Save and share it! You can always come back and edit a form.
