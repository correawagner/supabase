I am currently developing a management tool for my sports school. Among other things, it will be used to plan courses.

Now I need the possibility to create multiple relations between two tables.

For example, I have a user table and one for the courses. In the courses the trainers are listed (can be several / linkd to the user table) as well as the participants (also from the user table). A separate trainer table is not an option, because they can also be participants in other lessons. Is there a possibility?
