hey @roker15 thanks for you question

as this is related to [my response](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions/3232#discussioncomment-1343550) to one of your [previous questions](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions/3232) it would be most useful to add this as a comment response to that thread in order to better help future users find answers, and to avoid spamming the main discussion board
