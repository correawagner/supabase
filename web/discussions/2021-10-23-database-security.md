Hi there,

I've worked in or managed development teams for almost 15 years. In whatever company or system I've worked on, the database is securely tucked away behind a firewall and/or multiple layers of authentication.

On Supabase, the Postgres DB seems to be fully accessible with read/write with just a plain username and password.

Is that right?

Could it be vulnerable to a stolen password, or brute-forcing?

I'm not a Postgres or DB guy, just the part of the team that would be worried about security, so I might be misunderstanding the setup with Supabase.

Can someone help me sleep better at night please? üòÄ

  Hi @christrunk!

Postgres DB used in Supabase is behind an authentication layer just like any other databases out there.

As long as you have configured [row level security policies](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security), your database should be nice and secure. Gotrue, the authentication server used in Supabase has mechanisms to prevent brute-forcing as you can see [here](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue/blob/master/api/api.go#L125). Whether a stolen password could be critical or not is up to how you configure your security policy, I think.
