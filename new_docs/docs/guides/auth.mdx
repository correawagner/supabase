## User Management

Supabase makes it simple to manage your users.

When users sign up, Supabase assigns them a unique ID. You can reference this ID anywhere in your database. For example, you might create a profiles table referencing id in the auth.users table using a user_id field.

Supabase provides the routes to sign up, log in, log out, and manage users in your apps and websites.
